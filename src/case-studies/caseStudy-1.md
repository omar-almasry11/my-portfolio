## My Role
As the lead developer for this project, working with the Dubai Holding technical team, I was responsible for:  

- Building the entire website from scratch on Webflow
- Tackling SEO-related issues in coordination with the SEO team
- Extending the functionality of the website with custom code and third-party apps as needed
- Ensuring the website was fully bilingual (Arabic and English) using Webflow's localization
- Overcoming unique challenges associated with RTL (right-to-left) websites
- Rebuilding and enhancing the original WordPress website on Webflow

## Challenges
Developing a bilingual website that supports both LTR (left-to-right) and RTL (right-to-left) text presented unique challenges, especially in terms of layout and user experience. Collaborating with the SEO team to ensure all technical aspects of SEO were addressed, including meta tags, alt text, and sitemap configurations, was crucial. 

Rebuilding the website on Webflow required careful planning and execution to ensure all functionalities were maintained or enhanced. Additionally, integrating custom code and third-party apps to enhance the website's functionality posed its own set of challenges.

## Solution
To tackle these challenges, we leveraged Webflowâ€™s powerful localization features to create a seamless bilingual experience for users. Custom CSS and JavaScript were implemented to handle the intricacies of RTL support and to add unique functionalities. By working closely with the SEO team, we ensured that the website was fully optimized for search engines. Extensive testing was conducted to ensure compatibility across different browsers and devices, particularly for RTL support. These solutions collectively ensured the website was user-friendly, functional, and optimized for performance and SEO.
