## About the Project
Pixlee TurnTo was a leader in Social User-Generated Content (UGC), Ratings & Reviews, and Influencer Marketing, serving enterprise clients globally. Acquired by Emplifi, the project involved migrating their extensive blog and CMS system from WordPress to Webflow to improve performance, SEO, and usability. With a blog consisting of over 850 pages and a global audience, the migration required a meticulous approach to preserve rankings and optimize user experience.

## My Role
As the lead developer for this project, I was responsible for:

- **Migration Strategy** – Ensured all blog pages and their metadata were preserved to maintain SEO rankings.  
- **Webflow Development** – Rebuilt the blog on Webflow, creating templates and CMS configurations to handle dynamic content effectively.  
- **Feature Implementation** – Added new features, such as active filtering for blog posts, automated date ranges for posts, and enhanced search functionality.  
- **301 Redirects** – Configured redirects to prevent link-breaking issues and preserve site authority post-migration.  
- **Collaboration** – Worked closely with the marketing team to test and refine the structure for better user engagement.  

## Challenges
Migrating an enterprise-grade blog posed unique challenges:

- **Maintaining SEO Rankings**  
  Migrating over 850 pages without affecting their search engine rankings required a careful approach to handling metadata, URLs, and structured data.  

- **Recreating Complex Features**  
  The previous WordPress blog contained advanced filtering and categorization options that needed to be seamlessly integrated into Webflow’s system.  

- **Redirects & URL Structures**  
  Ensuring all old URLs were redirected accurately to the new system to avoid user confusion and loss of search traffic.  

## Solution
We leveraged Webflow’s robust CMS capabilities to deliver a scalable and high-performing blog:

- **Dynamic CMS Templates**  
  Built customizable CMS templates to streamline content updates, ensuring the in-house team could easily manage future posts.  

- **Advanced Filtering & Search**  
  Developed a filtering system to allow users to browse blog posts by category and date without reloading the page.  

- **301 Redirect Implementation**  
  Ensured all legacy URLs were redirected properly to maintain SEO equity and provide a seamless user experience.  

- **Performance Optimization**  
  Used Webflow’s CDN and image optimization tools to improve page load times across all devices.  

- **Custom Analytics Dashboard**  
  Implemented advanced tracking to monitor blog performance and user behavior, enabling data-driven decision-making.  

## Process Overview

### Planning & Discovery
- Conducted an audit of the existing WordPress blog to identify key pages, metadata, and content structures to migrate.  
- Collaborated with the marketing team to map out the new structure and optimize user flows.

### Development
1. **Webflow Build**  
   - Recreated the blog’s key features in Webflow, including filtering options, post previews, and category organization.  
2. **SEO Optimization**  
   - Transferred all metadata, alt text, and structured data into the new system to preserve rankings.  

### Testing & Launch
- Conducted cross-device and cross-browser testing to ensure a seamless experience for all users.  
- Finalized 301 redirects and deployed the blog, ensuring no downtime during the transition.  

### Post-Launch Support
- Monitored performance metrics and provided ongoing support to optimize content and troubleshoot any issues post-launch.  

This case study highlights the complexity of migrating a high-profile blog and the importance of maintaining SEO rankings, all while enhancing the user experience and performance.
