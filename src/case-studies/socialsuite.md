## Project Overview

**Client:** Socialsuite

**Timeline:** 6 weeks (November-December 2022)  
**My Role:** Lead Designer & Developer

## The Challenge

SocialSuite, a global leader in ESG and impact measurement software serving 150+ organizations worldwide—including YMCA, Big Brothers Big Sisters, and publicly traded companies—had just completed a comprehensive rebrand. Their existing website had become a critical bottleneck: outdated visuals, a confusing user experience, and alarmingly low conversion rates that didn't match their market position.

### The Core Problems

**1. Visual Identity Disconnect**  
The existing site relied heavily on generic stock illustrations and outdated branding that failed to communicate their premium positioning as an enterprise software provider serving both Fortune 500 companies and leading nonprofits.

**2. Poor Conversion Performance**  
With a homepage conversion rate of just 2.15%, the site was actively hindering growth. The client's goal was ambitious but necessary: double conversions to 4.5% while maintaining lead quality.

**3. Audience Confusion**  
A single "Book a Demo" flow attempted to serve two dramatically different audiences:

- **Social Impact users:** Nonprofits ($1-10M revenue) focused on community impact reporting

- **ESG users:** Public companies ($10M-2B market cap) navigating regulatory compliance

This one-size-fits-all approach created friction at every touchpoint.

## Discovery & Strategy

### Understanding Two Distinct Audiences

**Social Impact Segment**

- Mission-driven nonprofits and NGOs
- Primary need: Demonstrating community impact to funders
- Decision makers: Program directors, grant writers, executive directors
- Pain points: Complex reporting requirements, limited technical resources
- Tone: Approachable, mission-focused, impact-driven

**ESG Segment**

- Public and pre-IPO companies beginning ESG journey
- Primary need: Meeting regulatory requirements and investor expectations
- Decision makers: C-suite executives, sustainability officers, investor relations
- Pain points: Navigating complex frameworks (TCFD, GRI, SASB), stakeholder pressure
- Tone: Professional, data-driven, compliance-focused

### Competitive Analysis & Design Direction

I analyzed the client's reference sites (Slack, Wealthsimple, Pingboard, Flyhyer) and identified key patterns:

- Clean, spacious layouts with generous whitespace
- Custom illustrations that reinforce brand personality
- Clear, benefit-focused value propositions above the fold
- Conversion-optimized CTAs with minimal friction
- Strong visual hierarchy guiding users to key actions

### Strategic Approach

**Visual Strategy**  
Move from generic SaaS aesthetics to a sophisticated, purpose-driven design language that bridges corporate professionalism with nonprofit authenticity.

**Conversion Strategy**  
Implement separate, optimized demo flows and tailored value propositions for each audience. By reducing form friction through progressive disclosure and strategically placing social proof throughout the user journey, we streamlined the path to action and increased overall trust.

## Visual Identity Development

Based on the rebrand, I created an extended color palette, typography system, iconography set, and a photo asset guidelines to ensure brand consistency across all touchpoints.

### Color System & Typography

The rebrand provided a sophisticated color palette that I needed to translate into a functional web system:

**Primary Colors**

<div class="flex flex-wrap gap-8 tracking-tight my-8">
  <div class="flex flex-col items-center sm:items-start">
    <div class="w-16 h-16 rounded-xl shadow-low dark:shadow-lowInverted" style="background-color: #014682;"></div>
    <div class="mt-2 text-center sm:text-left">
      <p class="font-bold text-base mb-0 text-normal dark:text-inverted">Ocean</p>
      <span class="text-xs opacity-60 font-mono">#014682</span>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="flex flex-col items-center sm:items-start">
    <div class="w-16 h-16 rounded-xl shadow-low dark:shadow-lowInverted" style="background-color: #00a0aa;"></div>
    <div class="mt-2 text-center sm:text-left">
      <p class="font-bold text-base mb-0 text-normal dark:text-inverted">Lagoon</p>
      <span class="text-xs opacity-60 font-mono">#00a0aa</span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

**Secondary Palette**

<div class="flex flex-wrap gap-8 tracking-tight my-8">
  <div class="flex flex-col items-center sm:items-start">
    <div class="w-16 h-16 rounded-xl shadow-low dark:shadow-lowInverted" style="background-color: #00a0c8;"></div>
    <div class="mt-2 text-center sm:text-left">
      <p class="font-bold text-base mb-0 text-normal dark:text-inverted">Sky</p>
      <span class="text-xs opacity-60 font-mono">#00a0c8</span>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="flex flex-col items-center sm:items-start">
    <div class="w-16 h-16 rounded-xl shadow-low dark:shadow-lowInverted" style="background-color: #bcc896;"></div>
    <div class="mt-2 text-center sm:text-left">
      <p class="font-bold text-base mb-0 text-normal dark:text-inverted">Grass</p>
      <span class="text-xs opacity-60 font-mono">#bcc896</span>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="flex flex-col items-center sm:items-start">
    <div class="w-16 h-16 rounded-xl shadow-low dark:shadow-lowInverted" style="background-color: #00a096;"></div>
    <div class="mt-2 text-center sm:text-left">
      <p class="font-bold text-base mb-0 text-normal dark:text-inverted">Leaf</p>
      <span class="text-xs opacity-60 font-mono">#00a096</span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

**Deep Water Gradient**

<div class="w-full h-32 rounded-2xl my-6 shadow-medium dark:shadow-mediumInverted" style="background: linear-gradient(90deg, #014682 0%, #00a0aa 100%);"></div>

A sophisticated blue-to-teal gradient that added depth while maintaining accessibility—used strategically in hero sections to create visual interest without overwhelming content.

**Typography: Roboto**

<div class="w-full my-12 space-y-12">
  <!-- Specimen Header -->
  <div class="flex items-baseline gap-6 border-b border-slate-200 dark:border-white/10 pb-8">
    <span class="text-[10rem] md:text-[12rem] font-bold tracking-tighter text-normal dark:text-inverted leading-none" style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;">Aa</span>
    <div class="flex flex-col">
      <span class="text-3xl font-mono opacity-50">Roboto</span>
      <div class="flex gap-3 mt-4">
        <span class="text-xs uppercase tracking-widest opacity-40">Light 300</span>
        <span class="text-xs uppercase tracking-widest opacity-40">Regular 400</span>
        <span class="text-xs uppercase tracking-widest opacity-40">Bold 700</span>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Character Set -->
  <div class="space-y-4">
    <p class="text-xs uppercase tracking-[0.2em] opacity-40 font-bold">Characters & Numbers</p>
    <div class="text-4xl md:text-6xl tracking-[0.15em] text-normal dark:text-inverted leading-[1.4]" style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;">
        ABCDEFGHIJKLMN<br>
        OPQRSTUVWXYZ<br>
        abcdefghijklmn<br>
        opqrstuvwxyz<br>

    </div>
  </div>
    
  <!-- Rationale -->
  <div class="max-w-3xl">
    <p class="text-xl md:text-xl leading-relaxed text-normalLight dark:text-invertedLight">
      I selected Roboto for its versatility and clean, modern aesthetic. Its excellent readability across screen sizes and weights made it ideal for both data-heavy ESG content and emotion-driven impact storytelling.

### Custom Illustration System

<div class="w-full my-12">
  <img src="/images/socialsuite-custom-illustration-system-1.webp" alt="Socialsuite Custom Illustration System featured" class="w-full h-auto rounded-2xl shadow-medium">
</div>

**The Brief's Direction**

> "Custom design over stock photos... visual identity to be driven by our mission and vision"

**My Approach**  
Rather than generic SaaS illustrations, I developed a distinctive visual system that merged authentic photography with geometric abstraction:

<div class="space-y-8 my-12">
  <img src="/images/socialsuite-custom-illustration-system-2.webp" alt="Socialsuite Illustration Approach 1" class="w-full h-auto rounded-2xl shadow-medium">
  <img src="/images/socialsuite-custom-illustration-system-3.webp" alt="Socialsuite Illustration Approach 2" class="w-full h-auto rounded-2xl shadow-medium">
</div>

**Circular Frame System**  
Inspired by the client's new logo geometry, I created a series of circular frames using concentric line work. These frames served multiple purposes:

- **Brand consistency:** Echoed the circular motifs in the updated logo
- **Visual hierarchy:** Drew attention to key imagery while maintaining clean layouts
- **Versatility:** Worked across both nonprofit (warmer, human-focused) and corporate (cooler, professional) contexts

**Photography Treatment**

- Black-and-white photography for timeless, professional feel
- Subtle color overlays derived from brand palette (teal, blue, green gradients)
- Real people in authentic moments—no staged stock photography
- Images showing diverse industries: nonprofits, mining, tech, manufacturing

**Expanding the Logo Concept**  
The SocialSuite logo is constructed from overlapping circles—a visual representation of connection and impact. When the team decided to move away from traditional illustrations entirely, I saw an opportunity to expand on this circular language as a design system. By using concentric circles, overlapping geometric shapes, and circular frames throughout the site, I created visual interest and brand cohesion without relying on illustration.

Those circular elements became the "illustrations"—adding depth and visual appeal to sections that would typically feature custom graphics, while maintaining the clean, professional aesthetic the rebrand required.

  <img src="/images/socialsuite-circles-concept-2.webp" alt="Socialsuite Logo Geometry Concept 2" class="w-full h-auto rounded-2xl shadow-medium">
</div>

**Icon System**  
To ensure visual consistency across all touchpoints, I implemented the Phosphor icon library—a free, open-source, MIT-licensed icon system. The duotone style aligned perfectly with the brand's modern aesthetic while providing the SocialSuite team with a comprehensive library for use across their website, product interface, and marketing materials. This created a unified visual language that extended beyond the website redesign.
