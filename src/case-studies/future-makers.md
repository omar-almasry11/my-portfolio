## My Role
As the lead developer for this project, I was responsible for implementing key features that aligned with the client’s goals of improving content strategy and fostering educator relationships. My contributions included:

- **Blog Development** – Built a fully functional, SEO-optimized blog that the in-house team could easily update without requiring developer support.  
- **Membership System Creation** – Designed and implemented an "Educators' Portal" for logged-in users to access exclusive content, including features such as email verification, password resets, and favoriting content.  
- **Custom Analytics & Reporting** – Developed a robust tracking system to separate member and non-member activity, providing actionable insights through a custom Google Analytics dashboard in Looker Studio.  

## Challenges
The project presented a unique set of challenges that required strategic problem-solving and technical execution:

- **User-Friendly Blog**  
  Ensuring the blog was not only easy to update by the client’s non-technical in-house team but also optimized for SEO to improve content visibility and ranking.  
- **Membership System Complexity**  
  Building a membership system with email verification, content gating, and user-specific features while maintaining a seamless experience for both logged-in and regular users.  
- **Custom Analytics Requirements**  
  Writing custom code to track and segment user activity based on membership status and translating this data into meaningful reports for decision-makers.  

## Solution
A tailored approach was taken to address each challenge and deliver a high-performing solution:

- **SEO-Optimized Blog**  
  Developed a blog that adhered to SEO best practices, including meta tags, structured data, and performance optimization, to enhance content visibility and search rankings.  
- **Feature-Rich Membership System**  
  Built the Educators’ Portal with intuitive features such as account creation, email verification, password management, and a "favorites" system for saving educational guides.  
- **Custom Analytics & Dashboard**  
  Created a tracking system to separate member and non-member activity and visualized the data in a custom Looker Studio dashboard, providing insights into content engagement and user behavior.  

## The Process

### Blog Development
The blog was designed to align with the client’s inbound marketing strategy and ensure ease of use:
- **Content Management**  
  Integrated a simple, intuitive CMS that allowed the in-house team to create, edit, and publish blog posts without technical support.  
- **SEO Optimization**  
  Incorporated meta tags, alt text, and schema markup to ensure maximum visibility on search engines.  

### Educators’ Portal
The membership system was developed to foster deeper engagement with educators and provide exclusive access to valuable resources:
- **User Features**  
  Implemented email verification, password reset functionality, and a favorites system for saving content.  
- **Content Gating**  
  Restricted certain pages and resources to logged-in members to encourage sign-ups and provide exclusive value.  

### Custom Analytics & Dashboard
To give the client actionable insights, I built a custom tracking and reporting solution:
- **Traffic Segmentation**  
  Used custom code to distinguish between logged-in and general user activity, allowing for detailed behavioral analysis.  
- **Looker Studio Dashboard**  
  Designed a unified dashboard that visualized key metrics such as page views, content engagement, and user behavior for both members and non-members.  

By leveraging these solutions, the client was able to enhance their content strategy, build meaningful relationships with educators, and gain valuable insights into user behavior to inform future decisions.
