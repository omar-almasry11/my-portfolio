## My Role
In collaboration with the Dubai Holding technical team, I led all web development efforts:

- **Platform Migration & Build** – Rebuilt the WordPress website from scratch on Webflow  
- **SEO Coordination** – Collaborated closely with the SEO team to address technical needs  
- **Localization** – Enabled bilingual functionality (Arabic and English), ensuring seamless right-to-left (RTL) support  
- **Custom Development** – Integrated specialized code snippets and third-party apps for advanced capabilities  

## Challenges
Creating a **bilingual** website for both LTR (English) and RTL (Arabic) posed significant layout and user experience challenges. Migrating a complex WordPress site to Webflow without losing functionality required meticulous planning. Furthermore, performance and SEO goals demanded close collaboration—particularly in configuring sitemaps, meta tags, and alt text for images.

## Solution
We employed **Webflow’s native localization** features to streamline the bilingual experience. Custom CSS and JavaScript were introduced to ensure smooth RTL rendering, while third-party integrations provided additional capabilities. Close coordination with the SEO team allowed for comprehensive optimization, from technical metadata to image alt text and sitemaps. Rigorous testing across devices and browsers verified that all design, performance, and accessibility standards were met.

### Performance & SEO Enhancements
- **Reduced Load Times** – Through optimized images, efficient coding, and Webflow’s content delivery network (CDN), average page load times improved noticeably.  
- **Higher Google Audit Scores** – Implementing best practices for CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design resulted in stronger PageSpeed Insights and Lighthouse scores.  
- **Improved Search Rankings** – A combination of technical SEO fixes (meta tags, schema markup) and on-page optimizations led to a measurable boost in organic search visibility.

## Process Overview

1. **Planning & Discovery**  
   - Collaborated with stakeholders to establish key requirements and success metrics  
   - Audited the existing WordPress site to identify necessary features and content  

2. **Design & Prototyping**  
   - Developed wireframes and prototypes in close consultation with the client  
   - Ensured design decisions aligned with branding and user experience goals  

3. **Development**  
   - Built the core site structure in Webflow, utilizing custom code where needed  
   - Added third-party apps and integrations to expand capabilities, such as forms and analytics  

4. **Testing & Optimization**  
   - Conducted cross-browser and cross-device tests, paying special attention to RTL layouts  
   - Collaborated with the SEO team to refine metadata, sitemaps, and other ranking factors  

5. **Launch & Ongoing Support**  
   - Deployed the site, monitored performance metrics, and provided training to the in-house team  
   - Continued to offer support and implement incremental improvements
