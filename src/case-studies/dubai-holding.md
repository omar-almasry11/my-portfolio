## My Role

As an enterprise development partner, I collaborated with teams across Dubai Holding's portfolio:

- **Platform Migrations**
  Led migrations from Sitefinity and WordPress to Webflow, preserving existing SEO rankings and improving performance.

- **Component Library Design**
  Designed and built reusable component libraries that enabled consistent, rapid deployment across multiple properties.

- **Bilingual & RTL Implementation**
  Delivered seamless Arabic/English experiences with proper right-to-left support and Webflow's native localization.

- **Accessibility Compliance**
  Achieved WCAG AA conformance for retail properties, ensuring inclusive experiences for all users.

- **SEO Preservation & Optimization**
  Coordinated with SEO teams to maintain rankings during migrations through proper redirects, metadata, and technical optimizations.

- **Ongoing Support**
  Provided continued development support across teams, enabling them to scale their digital presence independently.

## The Challenge

Migrating an enterprise portfolio to a new platform is high-stakes work. Each website serves thousands of users monthly, and any disruption to SEO rankings or user experience has real business impact. The scope included:

- **Multiple Teams, Multiple Requirements** — Each business unit had unique needs, from destination marketing to retail experiences.
- **SEO Preservation** — Years of organic search equity needed to be protected during migrations.
- **Bilingual Complexity** — Several properties required full Arabic/English support with RTL layouts.
- **Accessibility Standards** — Retail properties needed WCAG AA compliance for inclusive access.
- **Scalability** — Solutions needed to work across properties, not just one-off implementations.

## Featured Project: Nad Al Sheba Mall

<a href="https://www.nadalshebamall.ae/" target="_blank" class="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 hover:underline mb-4 inline-block">nadalshebamall.ae ↗</a>

For Dubai Holding's retail properties, I designed and built a component library that prioritized accessibility from the ground up. This library was first implemented for Nad Al Sheba Mall and later reused for <a href="https://www.circlemall.ae/" target="_blank" class="underline">Circle Mall</a>.

### What I Delivered

- **Accessible Component Library** — Built a reusable system of components designed to meet WCAG AA standards.
- **WCAG AA Conformance** — Achieved accessibility compliance, ensuring the site is usable by people with disabilities.
- **Scalable Architecture** — The same component library powers multiple retail properties, ensuring consistency and reducing development time.

I also contributed to website migrations for Dubai Holding's **Nakheel** brand properties, helping consolidate their digital presence on the Webflow platform.

## Technical Approach

### Migration Methodology
Each migration followed a structured process: auditing the existing site, mapping content and URL structures, implementing proper 301 redirects, and validating SEO preservation post-launch.

### Accessibility Standards
Component libraries were built with accessibility as a foundation — proper heading hierarchy, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and color contrast ratios meeting WCAG AA requirements.

### Bilingual Implementation
Leveraged Webflow's native localization features combined with custom CSS for RTL layouts, ensuring consistent experiences across language variants.

### Performance Optimization
Implemented image optimization, efficient code patterns, and CDN delivery to achieve fast load times across all properties.
